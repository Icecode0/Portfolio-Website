            <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
              I'm Ice, a full stack developer, systems architect, and lifelong gamer who started building software out of necessity, not theory. 
              My first app wasn't for a class or a portfolio piece â€” it was a Flutter mobile app I built on the railroad while working as a project manager.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
              The goal was simple: eliminate paperwork and make inspections smarter. My app let crews input track inspection data in the field, 
              automatically stored it by section of track, and displayed results on a Google Maps overlay showing what was in or out of FRA compliance. 
              I automated the process so that even someone with limited knowledge could walk into the field and know exactly what was safe and what needed attention.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-300">
              I went further by designing an Arduino device that rolled down the track, measured rail gage, uploaded the data automatically, 
              and flagged weak spots before they became serious problems. That was the moment I realized the power of code: turning hours of paperwork, 
              guesswork, and manual labor into a process that was faster, safer, and more reliable.

          <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
            I'm a dad, a gamer, and a builder at heart. Running gaming communities taught me more about people than any class ever could. 
            I understand what players want because I live it myself, and that perspective drives how I approach design, performance, and user experience.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
            Whether I'm optimizing a backend service at midnight, designing a UI that feels natural, or messing with a 3D model in Blender, 
            my approach is the same: work hard, solve problems, and make it better than it was yesterday.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-300">
            I carry the same grit I learned in blue-collar work into development, and I believe in creating things that last, things that scale, 
            and things that actually matter.
